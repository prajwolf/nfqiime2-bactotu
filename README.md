# nfqiime2-bactotu
Nextflow implementation of Qiime2 for metabarcoding bacteria16S or fungusITS

This pipeline performs metabarcoding (amplicon metagenomics) analysis, specifically designed to perform the analysis of Bacterial 16S (V3-V4) metagenomics data utilizing Qiime2 tool.
Due to similarity in the workflow, this pipeline can also perform the analysis of Fungus ITS (300-500bp) metagenomics data.

For Bacterial 16S, download the Silva classifier qza file.
For Fungus ITS, download the Unite classifier qza file.
